- **1.** Generics are gone from some of the interfaces, and instead the type name tells us what
primitive type is involved. In other cases, such as `IntFunction`, only the return type
generic is needed because weâ€™re converting a primitive int into an object.
**2.** The single abstract method is often renamed when a primitive type is returned.
- Which functional interface would you use to fill in the blank to make the following code compile?
  ```java
  var d = 1.0;
  ______________ f1 = x->1;
  f1.applyAsInt(d);`
  ```
  When you see a question like this, look for clues. You can see that the functional interface in 
  question takes a `double` parameter and returns an `int`. You can also see that it has a single 
  abstract method named `applyAsInt`. The `DoubleToIntFunction` and `ToIntFunction` functional 
  interfaces meet all three of those criteria.
